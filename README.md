## Hellow and welcome to my GitHub profile page! <br>
My name is Sergey Kuroptev and I am a Data Scientist and an ML enthusiast.<br>
Here in various repositories, I am accumulating experience and knowledge while advancing on this unique and extremely interesting (and sometimes challenging) career path.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing several personal projects. More details on this later.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ping me on my LinkedIn profile page or Telegram.
  
- âš¡ Question of the day: Why did the chicken cross the road? The answer is trivial and is left as an exercise for the reader.
